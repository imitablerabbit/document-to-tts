# TTS Web Interface
This is the web application for the TTS document reader. It is a simple web application that allows you to upload a document and have it read to you. Documents are stored in the `documents` folder.

## Usage
To use the web application, simply run `make start` in the `web` folder. This will start a local web server on port 8080. You can then navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser to use the application.

Documents can then be uploaded to the server via the web interface. Once uploaded, the page will load the document contents and audio. The audio will be played automatically.
